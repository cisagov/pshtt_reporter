\section{Executive Summary}
\label{sec:executive summary}
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) connections can be easily monitored, modified, and impersonated; HTTPS remedies each vulnerability. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) ensures that browsers always use an https:// connection, and removes the ability for users to click through certificate-related warnings.

In 2015, \href{https://https.cio.gov/}{OMB M-15-13} required all existing Federal websites and web services to be accessible through a secure connection (HTTPS-only, with HSTS). In 2017, the .gov registry began \href{https://home.dotgov.gov/hsts-preloading/}{automatically preloading} new federal .gov domains as HSTS-only in modern browsers. Federal agencies must make more progress on HTTPS and HSTS deployment, including by removing support for known-weak cryptographic protocols and ciphers.

This weekly report, created by the National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services (NCATS) team inside the Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), is intended to assist your agency to comply with the web security aspects of Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 18-01. Implementation guidance can be found at \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/guide}{https://cyber.dhs.gov/guide} and \href{https://https.cio.gov}{https://https.cio.gov}.  This report also helps agencies to \href{https://https.cio.gov/hsts/#hsts-preloading}{``preload" their domains} to better enforce the protections BOD 18-01 requires.

We measure the presence and enforcement of HTTPS for your agency's publicly-accessible .gov domains. \textbf{This report includes all agency-registered \href{https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv}{second-level .gov domains} and known subdomains}, collectively referred to as ``hostnames" in this document (see the \hyperref[app:methodology]{\color{dhs-blue}{Methodology}} section for a description of how these hostnames are collected). Hostnames which do nothing but redirect to other websites \textit{are} measured. Hostnames that did not respond to HTTP/HTTPS requests are considered `non-web' and are removed from the compliance figures below.

<<&agency>> owns \numprint{<<base_domain_count>>} second-level .gov domains and NCATS discovered \numprint{<<subdomain_count>>} subdomains. Of these, \textbf{\numprint{<<all_eligible_domains_count>>} hostnames responded to HTTP/HTTPS requests over the public Internet:}
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
  \item \numprint{<<eligible_domains_count>>} second-level .gov domains
  \item \numprint{<<eligible_subdomains_count>>} subdomains
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{5mm}
Of \textit{\numprint{<<all_eligible_domains_count>>} hostnames that respond to HTTP/HTTPS}:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
  \item \textbf{\numprint{<<domain_supports_https_count>>}} hostnames (<<uses_https_percentage>>\%) have HTTPS enabled
  \item \textbf{\numprint{<<domain_enforces_https_count>>}} hostnames (<<enforces_https_percentage>>\%) default to HTTPS
  \item \textbf{\numprint{<<domain_uses_strong_hsts_count>>}} hostnames (<<hsts_percentage>>\%) use Strong HSTS
  \item \textbf{\numprint{<<domain_has_no_weak_crypto_count>>}} hostnames (<<has_no_weak_crypto_percentage>>\%) do not support SSLv2, SSLv3, 3DES, or RC4
  \item \textbf{\numprint{<<bod_1801_count>>}} hostnames (<<bod_1801_percentage>>\%) are \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov}{BOD 18-01} Compliant for web security

The following table shows where each <<&agency>> domain falls along the spectrum of BOD 18-01 web security compliance and whether the domain is preloaded. To be \hyperlink{BOD 18-01 Web Compliant}{BOD 18-01 web compliant}, a domain must meet all of the following: `Uses HTTPS', `Enforces HTTPS', `Uses Strong Strict Transport Security (HSTS)', `Free of SSLv2, SSLv3, 3DES, RC4'. Definitions of the field values are in ``\hyperlink{Field Descriptions}{\color{dhs-blue}{Field Descriptions}}", after the table below.\\~\\

BOD 18-01 includes \href{https://https.cio.gov/guide/#what-about-domains-that-are-technically-public-but-in-practice-are-only-used-internally}{\textbf{all domains and subdomains that are publicly reachable over HTTP/HTTPS}}, regardless of whether those hostnames are in practice only used internally.\\~\\

\textbf{Subdomains of domains that are HSTS preloaded are not shown below;} preloading ensures those domains' compliance with the HTTPS-only requirement of BOD 18-01. All known subdomains are included in the attachment \texttt{pshtt-results.csv}.\\~\\
%Note that if a parent domain uses \texttt{includeSubDomains} as part of its HSTS policy, subdomains with a score or ``No" for `HSTS' may be in compliance.

\textit{Values: \checkmark (uses), \xmark \ (does not use, or uses with: Bad chain, Bad hostname, Expired certificate)}\\~\\

Whether a site can be used over HTTPS, on either its bare domain or its www subdomain. Sites that appear to redirect ``down" from HTTPS to HTTP are given an \xmark. %Domains with ``Bad chain" or ``Expired certificate" are considered `supported' for count purposes, but warnings are likely to be presented to many users.
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item ``Bad chain" indicates that either (1) a ``chain" of intermediate certificates are missing that would provide the connecting client enough information to connect the certificate to a trusted root certificate, or (2) that the server certificate chains to a root that is not in the user's root store. Our scans use the \href{https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs}{Mozilla root store}.
	\item ``Bad hostname" indicates there is a mismatch between the hostname in question and the hostnames listed on a certificate's Common Name field and/or Subject Alternative Name extension.
	\item ``Expired certificate" is the value for certificates that have a ``Not Valid After" date before the date of our scan.\\
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}
In \texttt{pshtt}, ``Uses HTTPS" is mapped to the value for `Domain Supports HTTPS'. It is calculated:

\textit{Values: \checkmark (enforces), \xmark \ (does not enforce)}\\~\\

Whether a hostname appears to ``default" to using HTTPS (a hostname must have a \checkmark for `Uses HTTPS' to qualify). A hostname where `Redirect' is false is allowed to eventually redirect to an https:// URI. A hostname where `Redirect' is true must immediately redirect clients to an https:// URI (even if that URI is on another domain).\\~\\

In \texttt{pshtt}, ``Enforces HTTPS" is mapped to the value for `Domain Enforces HTTPS'. It is calculated:
\begin{center}
\normalsize\textit{(Domain Supports HTTPS == ``True" AND\\

\textit{Values: \checkmark (implements), \xmark \ (does not implement HSTS, or implements HSTS with low max-age)}\\~\\

Whether a hostname has implemented strong \href{https://https.cio.gov/hsts}{HTTP Strict Transport Security}. HSTS is an HTTP response header that directs \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security#Browser_support}{supporting browsers} to, after the first visit, only communicate with a hostname over HTTPS for the duration of \texttt{max-age} (even if the user clicks or types a plain HTTP link).\\

\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item \checkmark means that a valid Strict-Transport-Security header with at least \texttt{max-age=31536000} (1 year) is present on the hostname's default endpoint. (For increased security, you should consider the full HSTS preloading of the parent domain, which includes all subdomains.)
	\item ``Low max-age" indicates that a valid Strict-Transport-Security header is present, but the max-age is below 31536000 as required by BOD 18-01.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}
In \texttt{pshtt}, ``Uses Strong Strict Transport Security (HSTS)" is mapped to the value for `Domain Uses Strong HSTS'. It is calculated:

Whether a hostname meets all of the following criteria for being compliant with \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov}{BOD 18-01} for web security:
  \begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
    \item Uses HTTPS

\vspace*{-6mm}
\textit{Values: \checkmark (yes), \xmark (no), Preload-ready, Pending}

\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item \checkmark indicates that a domain is visibly preload-ready (\texttt{preload} is indicated in the HSTS header) and that the domain is actually in the public versioned \href{https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/net/+/master/http/transport_security_state_static.json}{Chrome preload list}. Reaching this step effectively means that a domain's namespace is permanently and fully committed to HTTPS.
	\item ``Preload-ready" indicates the domain meets the submission requirements for preloading, as outlined at the \href{https://hstspreload.appspot.com}{HSTS Preload List site}, but is not in the public versioned Chrome preload list. Be aware that ``preload-ready" domains can be submitted \textit{by anyone at any time} to the HSTS Preload List site. This submission could potentially have negative effects if you have intranet subdomains that do not support HTTPS. The \texttt{includeSubDomains} directive in the HSTS header will, when preloaded, direct browsers to enforce HTTPS. Because HSTS disables the capability to click through security warnings, these subdomains will effectively be inaccessible to your users. If your domain is not ready to be preloaded, you should consider removing the \texttt{preload} directive in the HSTS header.

\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item Yes indicates that a Symantec SSL certificate is currently in use and requires a new SSL certificate to be issued. This is required because Symantec's change in PKI infrastructure will result in failed compliance for the BOD 18-01 requirement of ``Uses HTTPS" and ``Enforces HTTPS".
	\item No indicates that the hostname is free of a Symantec SSL certificate and is therefore unaffected by their PKI infrastructure change.  No action is needed in this case.

\subsection*{What else should I do?}
\vspace*{-3mm}

BOD 18-01 \textbf{requires} <<&agency>> to evaluate which domains can be added to the \href{https://https.cio.gov/hsts/#hsts-preloading}{HSTS preload list}.\\~\\

For a user to take advantage of HSTS, their browser does have to see the HSTS header at least once. This means that users are not protected until after their first successful secure connection to a given domain.\\~\\

In addition, in many cases, there may never be a first visit to \texttt{https://domain.gov}. For example:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item Many federal websites redirect directly from \texttt{http://domain.gov} to \texttt{https://www.domain.gov}.
	\item Many federal domains that are used solely for redirects will redirect from \texttt{http://source.gov} directly to \texttt{https://destination.gov}.
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{2mm}
In these cases, \texttt{https://domain.gov} and \texttt{https://source.gov} are never visited, meaning connecting clients will never see an HSTS policy with an \texttt{includeSubDomains} directive that applies to the whole zone.\\~\\

To solve this problem, the Chrome security team created an `HSTS preload list': a list of domains baked into Chrome that get Strict Transport Security enabled automatically, even for the first visit. Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge also incorporate Chrome's HSTS preload list, making this feature shared across major browsers.\\~\\

%M-15-13 requires HTTPS be served and that an HSTS policy is in force. However, in order for a user to take advantage of the protection HSTS provides, their browser has to see the HSTS header at least once. This means that users are not protected until after their first successful secure connection to a given domain. This presents an opportunity for an attacker to capture information about the visitor (such as cookies from a previous secure session) or to maliciously redirect the user to a phishing site.\\~\\

%To solve the ``first visit" problem, Google created an `HSTS preload list'. This list, which gets incorporated directly into most modern browsers, consists of those domains that have Strict Transport Security enabled automatically, even for the first visit. Domains that comply with M-15-13 can better protect their users by adding themselves to the preload list. This requires that a domain take the first approach described above, which includes those where the domain has an HSTS policy of ``Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload". This necessarily includes those subdomains that are in use solely on intranets.\\~\\

%Preloading takes on even greater importance because, in many cases, there may never be a first visit. For an HSTS policy that includes subdomains to take effect without preloading, the user must connect (``200 OK") to \textbf{https}://domain.gov (as the HSTS header is not cached by browsers unless there is a valid secure connection). Even if a user types `domain.gov' by hand, many Federal websites redirect from http://domain.gov to the `www' subdomain, leaving https://domain.gov unvisited. ``Vanity domains" or domains used solely for redirects {\it that don't first redirect to the secure versions of themselves also are never visited over HTTPS} and thus an HSTS policy that includes subdomains will not be successfully set with connecting clients.\\~\\

You are encouraged to \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/guide/#how-should-the-list-of-second-level-domains-to-be-preloaded-be-shared-with-dhs}{preload your domains yourself} and then to report the set of preloaded domains to DHS in your \href{https://cyber.dhs.gov/guide/#checklist}{Agency Plan of Action}.\\~\\

\subsection*{What domains are measured?}
\vspace*{-3mm}

This report measures the presence and enforcement of HTTPS for <<&agency>>'s publicly-accessible domains and subdomains. Hostnames which do nothing but redirect to other websites \textit{are} measured.\\~\\

Each domain and subdomain is assessed on four ``endpoints":\\
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
	\item \textbf{http://\hspace{5em}}2. \textbf{http://www\hspace{5em}}3. \textbf{https://\hspace{5em}}4. \textbf{https://www}
\end{enumerate}
\vspace*{2mm}
Data from these endpoints is used to characterize the overall behavior of a hostname. These measurements are performed using \texttt{pshtt}, our \href{https://github.com/dhs-ncats/pshtt}{open source HTTPS scanner}. All owned \href{https://github.com/GSA/data/blob/master/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv}{.gov domains} and known subdomains are included. Subdomains are gathered from the following sources:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=-6pt, itemsep=0pt]
  \item General Services Administration's Digital Analytics Program (DAP), which nightly publishes a \href{https://analytics.usa.gov/data/live/sites-extended.csv}{dataset of federal hostnames} for which the DAP observed at least one recorded visit in the previous 14 days.
  \item \href{https://censys.io}{Censys} is used to query the `Common Name' field and `Subject Alternative Name' extension on X.509 certificates found on Federal .gov sites, derived from scans of the IPv4 space and from certificates submitted to public Certificate Transparency logs.
  \item \href{http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/}{End of Term Web Archive Project}, which captures and saves U.S. Government websites at the end of presidential administrations.
  \item Hostnames gathered from Cyber Hygiene scans.
\end{itemize}

Our scans use the \href{https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:IncludedCAs}{Mozilla CA Certificate Store}. This trust store most accurately represents what roots are ``publicly trusted", and is used in Firefox, Android, Linux, and many commercial and open source network security tools. Note that the Federal Common Policy CA, the Federal trust anchor, \href{https://https.cio.gov/certificates/#does-the-us-government-operate-a-publicly-trusted-certificate-authority}{is not currently trusted} by the Mozilla CA Certificate Store.\\~\\

M-15-13/BOD 18-01 have no restrictions on acceptable certificate authorities agencies might use to meet their requirements. However, Federally issued certificates \href{https://https.cio.gov/guide/#what-if-im-using-a-federally-issued-certificate-such-as-from-the-federal-pki-or-department-of-defense-for-my-web-service}{will not be practical for web services} whose users may not always be expected to trust the issuing federal certificate authority.\\~\\~\\~\\~\\
